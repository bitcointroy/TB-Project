## Intro
Apartment investors see many properties for sale, and spend much of their
time in due dilligence investigating the area surrounding the property. This
project intends to shorten the time for investors in this phase by tracking
the features that make a location more or less desirable to residents.
Investors are looking for properties that can be purchased and improved in
order to maximize their return. Invest too much, and you'll never get that
money back. Invest too little, and your return will be ... underwhelming.

The MVP for this will be a heatmap that shows the overall desirability of the
residential areas within a metroplex. This will be overlayed with properties
for sale and each property will be scored by the potential to improve the
demand for the units without overspending for the neighborhood.
